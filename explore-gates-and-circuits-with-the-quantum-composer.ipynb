The reduced purity for a single qubit is in the range $[0.5, 1]$; a value of one indicates that the qubit is not entangled with any other party. In contrast, a reduced purity of $0.5$ shows that the qubit is left in the completely mixed state, and has some level of entanglement over the remaining $N-1$ qubits, and possibly even the environment.\n","\n","![purity of the qubit state](https://learning-api.quantum.ibm.com/assets/246a37dd-eeac-42cb-b42e-53e8b75b5379)\n","\n","### Probabilities view\n","\n","**8-qubit limit**\n","\n","This view visualizes the probabilities of the quantum state as a bar graph.

Basis states with the same number of zeros (or ones) lie on a shared latitude of the q-sphere (e.g., $|001\\rangle, |010\\rangle, |100\\rangle$). Beginning at the north pole of the q-sphere and progressing southward, each successive latitude has basis states with a greater number of ones; the latitude of a basis state is determined by its [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) from the zero state.

Indeed, like the [phase disk](#phase-disk), the Bloch sphere gives a *local* view of the quantum state, where each qubit is viewed on its own. When trying to understand how registers of qubits (multi-qubit states) behave upon the application of quantum circuits, it is more insightful to take a *global* view and look at the quantum state in its entirety. The q-sphere provides a visual representation of the quantum state, and thus this *global* viewpoint.
